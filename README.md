# terrible-website-contest-Zalpa

This website is a project to create the worst site ever possible.
We could also add some easter eggs, in my case I added a secret key combination with JavaScript:
If you press Ctrl + "v" you can see the correct layout but...
If you press Ctrl + "b" your computer could self-destruct
You can cancel self-destruct press Ctrl + "v" again
